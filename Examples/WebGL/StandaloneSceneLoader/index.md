## Standalone scene loader

The Standalone Scene Loader is more than a simple example, it is also an
application viewer by itself. No server needed. Just save the following [HTML]
file to your desktop. This enables you to look at saved scenes exported from
ParaView using this [macro].

An example scene can be downloaded from here [Dragon].
